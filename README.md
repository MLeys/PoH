## Pursuit of HealthYness Overview
Pursuit of HealthYness is a patient-first application. It empowers users to manage and take charge of their own health rather than depending on unreliable outside resources.
Users are able to organize medications, track appointments with different providers, add insurance information, find a provider within the area, and upload medical documentation. 
The application is focused on helping users pursue a life of healthy living.
